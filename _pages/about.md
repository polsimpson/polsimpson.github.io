Hello! I am a 4th year PhD student in economics at the London School of Economics (LSE). I'm affiliated with the [Environment and Energy (EEE) Programme](https://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/_new/our-work/economics-of-environment-and-energy/) at STICERD and the [Centre for Economic Performance](https://cep.lse.ac.uk/_new/people/person.asp?id=11236#:~:text=Pol%20Simpson%20is%20a%20PhD,the%20Institute%20for%20Fiscal%20Studies.) (CEP). 

Before starting the PhD, I worked at the [Institute for Fiscal Studies](https://ifs.org.uk).
