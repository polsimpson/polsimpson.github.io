Hello! I am a 4th year PhD student in economics at the London School of Economics (LSE). I'm affiliated with the [Environment and Energy (EEE) Programme]() at STICERD and the [Centre for Economic Performance]() (CEP). 

Before starting the PhD, I worked at the [Institute for Fiscal Studies](https://ifs.org.uk).

I have ongoing work on labor market frictions and gender inequality in low income countries. I also work on studying the impacts of, and adaptation to climate change in low income countries.
