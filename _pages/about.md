Hello! I am a 6th year PhD student in economics at the London School of Economics (LSE). I'm affiliated with the [Environment and Energy (EEE) Programme](https://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/_new/our-work/economics-of-environment-and-energy/) at STICERD and the [Centre for Economic Performance](https://cep.lse.ac.uk/_new/people/person.asp?id=11236#:~:text=Pol%20Simpson%20is%20a%20PhD,the%20Institute%20for%20Fiscal%20Studies.) (CEP). Before starting the PhD, I worked at the [Institute for Fiscal Studies](https://ifs.org.uk). I have a masters in economics from University College London, and a bachelors in economics and management from the University of Oxford. 

My research focuses on climate adaptation and natural disaster response in low income countries. I also work on global energy transition and green industrial policy. 

I am a co-organiser of [LSE Environment Week](https://www.lse-environment-week.com), LSE Environment Camp and the weekly Economics of Energy and Environment (EEE) hour at LSE. [Ananya Kotia](https://ananyakotia.com) and I organising [LSE QueerConf](https://www.lsequeerconf.com) - a one day conference for Queer PhD students in Economics. 

Outside of economics, I am fundraising secretary for [Pecs Education](https://pecseducation.com). Trans liberation now!  

## Work in Progress 

### Coping with Catastrophe: Pakistan’s 2022 Floods

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Disaster response policies often focus on immediate relief or long-term reconstruction, but what happens in between? We examine how the impacts of Pakistan's 2022 floods evolve over two years, by collecting panel data from 5,100 low-income households across six districts, and leveraging exogenous local variation in topography and rainfall to estimate causal effects. One year post-floods, a more severe flood shock depleted household assets and reduced labor demand, prompting households to sell assets, commute further for work, and turn to self-employment. They also received more formal and informal aid. As a result, they were able to sustain consumption levels on par with less affected households. However, by year two these patterns are reversed: more flooded households have returned to private employment, working similar hours as less flooded households, but doing so at lower wages. They are also more likely to report reducing consumption and health expenditure, taking new loans and drawing down savings to make ends meet. We also find that more intense floods have persistent negative impacts on physical and mental health - particularly women’s. These findings reveal a medium-run assistance gap: after emergency relief but before long-run reconstruction, households face income risks that standard disaster response overlooks, allowing the effects of climate shocks to persist through labor markets.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Heatwaves, intensified by climate change, hit the poorest the hardest. Many are exposed to dangerous temperatures through outdoor work or limited access to adaptive resources. In 2024, 37 cities in India surpassed 45°C (113°F), and around 40,000 heat stroke cases were reported. How can social protection systems evolve to address the growing losses caused by extreme heat? We evaluate an innovative intervention in India that offers automatic daily wage payments to low-income workers when temperatures exceed a predetermined threshold. Developed by the Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) – a union representing over 3 million informal workers – the scheme is the world’s first parametric heat insurance product targeting earnings loss. We use a randomized encouragement design, incentivizing SEWA officers to promote enrollment in 2,821 treatment villages, while 2,821 control villages receive no targeted outreach. Panel survey data – combined with high-frequency measurement during the hot season – will allow us to estimate impacts on labor supply, financial decisions, health, consumption, and adaptive behavior. We also assess willingness to pay relative to actuarially fair pricing, providing evidence on the potential for commercial insurance-based heat protection.

### Rebuilding Lives, Not Just Homes: Addressing Trauma in Disaster Recovery

  <summary>Abstract</summary>

  Disaster recovery often focuses on rebuilding physical infrastructure, overlooking the mental health impact of traumatic events like floods. In Pakistan, where flooding in 2022 submerged a third of the country and lasted up to 8 months, women exposed to a more intense flood shock were 11 pp more likely to have severe psychological distress 2 years later. Ignoring mental health in reconstruction may prolong the socio-economic impact of disasters by limiting individuals’ ability to work, plan, and recover. This project explores complementarities between mental health support and the standard infrastructure-focused approach by randomizing a trauma-based mental health intervention and leveraging natural variation in access to a housing reconstruction program in a 2x2 design. Our findings aim to measure the non-economic losses and damages of climate catastrophes, and inform more holistic disaster recovery policies that address both physical and psychological needs.

### Ray of Hope? China and the Rise of Solar Energy

(with Ignacio Bañares Sánchez, Robin Burgess, David Laszlow, John Van Reenen and Yifan Wang)

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The rapid decline in the global cost of solar panels from the early 2000s coincided with China's growing dominance in solar photovoltaics (PV) and its adoption of green industrial policies. We evaluate the effectiveness of local, city-level policies to encourage growth and innovation in the Chinese solar industry. Using new data on solar subsidy policies, patenting, production and trade and a synthetic-difference-in-differences approach, we show that production subsidies caused large increases in solar PV output, innovation and productivity. Cities combining production subsidies with R&D support had an even larger impact. We can reject negative spillovers to other cities, finding that business stealing effects are outweighted by knowledge spillovers. Although demand subsidies targeted at solar generation reduced pollution, they had little impact on local solar output and innovation, as additional demand was largely met by supply from other Chinese cities. We interpret these results through the lens of a quantified general equilibrium model with heterogeneous manufacturers, intra-national and international trade costs, and endogenous choices of R&D, entry/exit and trade. Our results suggest substantial benefits to China from its solar policy, even abstracting from the climate change externality. We draw implications for green industrial policies in other countries, suggesting such interventions can foster growth in clean energy.
